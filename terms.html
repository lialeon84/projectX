                            <p>Coder Geeks Inc., a Tennessee corporation (“Coder Geeks”, “we”, “us”) is the provider of certain online Web Services and related services known as the Coder Geeks Service (the “Service”). The Service is a business-to-business
                                service only. We conclude agreements only with customers who subscribe to the Service for purposes relating directly to their trade, business or profession. These Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”) set the rules
                                for the use of the Service by our customers.</p>
                            <p>
                                By subscribing to our Services the company, organization, or other business entity identified during the registration process (“you” or the “Customer”) thereby accepts and agrees to these Terms of Service and agrees to use the Service in compliance with
                                the provisions of this document. If an individual is subscribing to the Service, that individual thereby represents and warrants to us that she or he is authorized to do so (and is thereby doing so) on the Customer’s behalf.
                                You should retain a copy of these Terms of Service for your records, they constitute a legal agreement between you and Coder Geeks. If you do not agree with any of the provisions of this document, you may not subscribe
                                to or use the Service. We reserve the right to reject your request, registration or application for subscription to the Service (“Subscription”) for any or no reason as long as it is not an unlawful reason.

                            </p>
                            <h4>II. Service</h4>
                            <h6>1. General</h6>

                            <p>
                                Under the Service we provide you with:

                            </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Additional features (add-ons) and services. You’ll need to separately order and pay for some add-ons and services.</li>
                                <li>Customer Service as described below</li>
                                <li>Access to and use of our web-based, as made generally available to other Customers, that allows you to create, send, manage your marketing campaigns and host mailing lists on Coder Geeks platform by using tools such as:
                                    Landing Page Builder, and many others</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The detailed scope of Service features available to you under your Subscription (“Subscription Plan”) is provided at Coder Geeks Pricing, and depends on the “Pricing Option” and “List Size” that you choose.</p>
                            <p>You may use the Service to send emails only to those recipients who have given you permission to add them to your mailing list and have not subsequently withdrawn such permission (“Contacts”), unless you have another valid
                                legal basis to process your Contacts’ personal data within the Service.</p>

                            <h4>2. Upgrade</h4>

                            <p>You may upgrade your Subscription Plan or order an add-on at any time. If you purchase an add-on during the period for which you have subscribed to the Service (the “Subscription Period”), we will align your add-on billing
                                cycle with your Subscription Plan monthly cycle, so that the payment dates for all services under your Subscription Plan are in line. The initial add-on will therefore be calculated in proportion to the number of days remaining
                                until the end of the then current monthly cycle in your Subscription Plan.</p>


                            <h4>3. Domains</h4>

                                by law and pay us an additional amount so that we receive payment in full as if there were no deduction or withholding. Please note that some taxes depend on the region, province, state, town or district where you are located.
                                You need to provide us with your correct address at all times, as we do not bear any responsibility resulting from wrong calculation of taxes due to inaccurate or wrong indication of address by you.

                            <p>
                                We provide Customer Service via Email or Live Chat. When requesting customer service or submitting a complaint, you should provide at least your Account name – we do not reply or take any action based on “anonymous” support requests. Customer Service
                                contact details are available at our contact page. Most customer service enquiries are responded to within 24 hours on business days. You have the right to be advised about the processing status of your support request

                            <p>
                                You may cancel your Account at any time. Please note that if you cancel your Account, your Subscription will be terminated with immediate effect. The Coder Geeks Platform allows for restoring the Account (along with all data and Contacts List) within
                                90 days from the date of its deactivation – regardless of the reasons for the deactivation. Restoration of the Account is subject to prior payment of the Subscription fee and for the then next Subscription Period for the
                                Service. We reserve the right to refuse to restore any Account without reason (including but not limited to, if we cancel the Account due to our termination of your Subscription or suspension of the Service).
                            </p>

                            <h4>13. Termination</h4>
                            <p>
                                We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Subscription with immediate effect and refuse you any and all current or future use of the Service in the event that you violate any of the provisions of these Terms of Service or any other agreement with
                                Coder Geeks, or cancel your Account. We also reserve the right to terminate or suspend your Subscription to the Service at any time, without cause, with immediate effect, without incurring any liability as a result.

                            </p>

                            <h4>14. Refund Policy</h4>

                            <p>
                                When you purchase a Paid Account or upgrade from a 30-Day Free Trial to a Paid Account, the Coder Geeks billing system charges your credit card for the initial billing period (i.e. the 30-day, one year, or two-year Subscription Period, depending on your
                                Pricing Option). After that, the billing system automatically renews your Account every 30 days if you choose the monthly plan, (every 360 days if you choose the annual plan or 720 days if two-year Subscription is chosen)
                                and charges the appropriate amount to your credit card.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Cancellation/Termination: if you cancel your Account or if we terminate your Subscription for cause as specified above, no further amounts will be charged to your credit card. However, you are responsible for any amounts already charged to your credit
                                card.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Refund Policy: our Service is a pay-as-you-go service. Therefore, except as expressly provided below, we do not issue refunds, even if you cancel your Account immediately after your credit card is charged for a new billing period. For example, if we charge
                                your credit card on August 10th, and you cancel your Account on August 15th, you are still responsible for paying for the entire Subscription Period (30 days, one year, two years, depending on your subscription Plan). Upon
                                cancellation or termination, no subsequent charges will be applied to your credit card, but the amounts already charged are not refunded.
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                Unless otherwise stated in these Terms of Service the amounts paid by you under these Terms of Service are non-refundable. Therefore, termination of the Service does not release you from the obligation to pay all and any fees already due as per our Refund
                                Policy. Notwithstanding the above, if we terminate your Subscription without cause, then we will refund a pro rata portion of the amount you already prepaid for the portion of the Subscription remaining after the effective
                                termination date. Please note that cancellation or termination does not release you from the obligation to pay any fees already due as of the effective cancellation or termination date.
                            </p>
